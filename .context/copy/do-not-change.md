# Do Not Change — Fixed and Protected Elements

The following content and assets are considered immutable across all project iterations.

## 1. Brand Assets
- Logos (`.context/assets/logo.svg`, `favicon.ico`)  
  → Must never be altered, stretched, or recolored.
- Clearspace: maintain 50px minimum around logo in digital use.
- Color lock: use brand color as primary; no inversion allowed unless approved.

## 2. Legal Copy
- CGU, Mentions légales, and Privacy sections in `.context/copy/legal.md`
  → Content must remain legally compliant; wording cannot be edited by AI.

## 3. Taglines & Phrasing
- **Main tagline**: "{{OFFICIAL_TAGLINE}}" (must remain identical)
- **Registered names**: "{{CLIENT_BRAND}}" must always appear with correct capitalization.
- **Signature CTA**: "Demandez votre devis gratuit" → do not rewrite.

## 4. SEO-protected Elements
- Canonical URLs, Meta Titles, and Schema.org structured data → manual validation required.

## 5. Typography
- Font families defined in `.context/brand-tokens.json` are locked unless approved update.

## 6. Brand Story
- Text sections under “Notre mission” or “À propos” are company statements — minor edits allowed for grammar only.
