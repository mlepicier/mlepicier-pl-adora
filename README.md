## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for GitHub Pages deployment. There are two deployment methods:

### Method 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the main branch.

**Setup Steps:**

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to **Pages** under **Code and automation**
3. Under **Build and deployment**, select **Source: GitHub Actions**
4. Push your changes to the main branch
5. The site will be automatically deployed to `https://yourusername.github.io/mlepicier-pl-adora/`

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

To deploy manually using gh-pages:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

**Note:** For manual deployment, make sure GitHub Pages is set to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch in your repository settings.

## Configuration

The `vite.config.ts` is configured with:
- `base: '/mlepicier-pl-adora/'` - Update this if your repository name is different
- The router uses HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility
